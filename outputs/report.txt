Project: ML-based Spatio-Temporal Water Quality Forecasting
1. Introduction
Chandrapur Lake is an important water body that requires constant monitoring to ensure safe water quality. This project aims to predict water quality indices using a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model, providing early warning for potential pollution events.
Objectives:
Analyze historical water quality data.
Build a predictive model to forecast water quality indices.
Develop a Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization.
Provide actionable insights for local authorities.
2. Dataset
Raw Data: Collected from monitoring stations in Chandrapur Lake. Includes features such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and other chemical parameters.
Cleaned Data: Preprocessed to remove missing values, handle outliers, and normalize features.

3. Methodology
3.1 Data Cleaning
Missing values filled with mean values.
Outliers handled using interquartile range (IQR).
Features normalized to [0,1] range.
3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation analysis between features and water quality index.
Temporal trends analyzed using line plots.
Seasonal variations observed over 12-month periods.
3.3 Model: Spatio-Temporal Transformer
Model Architecture:
Input Dimension: 8 features
Hidden Dimension: 64
Output Dimension: 4
Transformer Encoder with 2 layers and 4 attention heads
Takes time-series sequences of water quality features as input
Advantages:
Captures temporal dependencies between months.
Learns feature interactions across time.
Provides accurate multi-step forecasting.
Training & Evaluation:
Trained on historical data using PyTorch.
Model weights saved as models/best_model.pth.
Evaluated using RMSE and MAE metrics.
4. Streamlit Dashboard
Interactive Sliders: Select forecast months and risk thresholds.
Predicted Water Quality Plot: Shows forecasted values for upcoming months.
Raw Predictions Table: Displays numerical values for reference.
Outputs Saved: Predictions and plots stored in outputs/ folder.
Example Dashboard Outputs:
Line chart of predicted water quality indices.
CSV of predicted values: outputs/predictions.csv.
Forecast plot: outputs/water_quality_forecast.png.

6. Conclusion
Successfully built a predictive model for Chandrapur Lake water quality.
Streamlit app provides interactive forecasts for stakeholders.
The pipeline is end-to-end: from data cleaning → model → predictions → dashboard → outputs.
Outputs can be stored as CSV and PNG for reports.

Future Work:
Integrate real-time monitoring sensors.
Add additional features like rainfall, industrial effluents, and upstream water quality.
Improve model accuracy with larger datasets.
